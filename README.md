# Genetic-Algorithm-Implementation
A comparative study of Genetic Algorithm and Dynamic Programming for solving the 0/1 Knapsack Optimization Problem. Includes penalty-based fitness, repair strategies, convergence stopping, and population scaling experiments to evaluate performance and feasibility of GA for large-scale optimization.
